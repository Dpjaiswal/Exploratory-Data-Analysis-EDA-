Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Task Overview
This project is part of the AI & ML internship where we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic Dataset to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in the data using statistical and visual methods.

# Dataset Used
Titanic dataset from Kaggle

# Tools & Libraries
Python 

Pandas 

NumPy 

Matplotlib 

Seaborn 

# What I Did (Steps Followed)
Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.

Explored the data using:

df.head(), df.info(), df.describe()

Checked missing values using df.isnull().sum()

Visualized data using:

Histograms for numeric distributions

Boxplots to detect outliers

Correlation matrix using Heatmap

Pairplot to explore feature relationships

Identified patterns, such as:

Survival rate was higher in 1st class and among females

Fare was right-skewed (outliers present)

Age had many missing values

# Key Insights
Females and children had higher survival rates.

Fare and Pclass are somewhat correlated with survival.

Outliers were present in Fare and Age columns.

Missing values were found mostly in the Age column.

# What I Learned
How to perform basic EDA using Python

How to detect skewness, outliers, and relationships between features

How visualizations help in understanding data better

# Submission
You can find the complete notebook in this repository along with the code, output plots, and this README.
