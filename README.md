Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Task Overview
This project is part of the AI & ML internship where we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic Dataset to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in the data using statistical and visual methods.

# Dataset Used
Titanic dataset from Kaggle

# Tools & Libraries
Python 

Pandas 

NumPy 

Matplotlib 

Seaborn 

# What I Did (Steps Followed)
Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.

Visualized data using:

Histograms for numeric distributions

Boxplots to detect outliers

Correlation matrix using Heatmap

Pairplot to explore feature relationships

Identified patterns, such as:

Survival rate was higher in 1st class and among females

Fare was right-skewed (outliers present)


# Key Insights
Females and children had higher survival rates.

Fare and Pclass are somewhat correlated with survival.

Outliers were present in Fare and Age columns.


# What I Learned
How to perform basic EDA using Python

How to detect skewness, outliers, and relationships between features

How visualizations help in understanding data better
